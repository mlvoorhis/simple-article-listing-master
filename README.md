## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlvoorhis/simple-article-listing-master/refs/heads/main/ProjectScreenshot.png)

This project was my first time using Flexbox and media queries to make a responsive site. I also learned about the importance of using non-pixel measurements when possible to make a webpage that looks good in different viewing environments. 

### Room for improvement
For some reason unbeknowst to me currently, the body was not acting as I expected it to. When I put a border around it to troubleshoot, I noticed it was not taking up the entire height of the page. Perhaps this is stemming from the flex style?

### Useful resources
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsTv9y931o8 - Helpful starting point for Flexbox
- https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-intermediate-css - Taught me about responsive webpages and media queries.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

## Features
This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
